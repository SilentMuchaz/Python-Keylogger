<h1>Python KeyLogger</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The KeyLogger project is a tool designed to help understand how computers interact with keyboards. It records the keys pressed on a computer keyboard and stores them in a text file for analysis. This project was created to explore the concept of keyboard input monitoring and to learn about the inner workings of computer systems.
<br />


<h2>Key Features</h2>

- <b>Keyboard Monitoring: The program listens for and records every key press on the keyboard.</b> 
- <b>Data Storage: It saves the recorded keystrokes in a text file for later review.</b>
- <b>Simple Operation: The program runs quietly in the background, capturing keystrokes without interfering with other tasks.</b>

<h2>Why Use KeyLogger:</h2>

- <b>Educational Purposes: KeyLogger allows for learning keyboard input handling in programming and computer security.</b>
- <b>Exploring Computer Interaction: Users can learn how computers process and record keyboard input.</b>
- <b>Technical Understanding: The project offers a hands-on experience in programming and system-level operations.</b>
